## Design Choices
I went with the classic Christmas color-theme, like you have your reds, greens, golds, and whites. Just wanted to make everything look more Christmas-y. 

## Functionalities 
The Home page is pretty close to the rubric, besides the whole select feature, which uses Javascript as a mini database to pull the photos and summaries. The gallery page is easily the simplest, but it does use Javascript to let the user click the photo and make it act like a photo book. The Form page was surpisingly the hardest, since I wanted to go all out and add Javascript when submitting the form. A little weird firework animation plays, and thanks the user for submitting. Thats basically it!
